# Component DataSheet
Here is a summarry of key specifications and justifications for component choice:

- LDR: Highlight light sensitivity range, response time, and resistance variation.

- RTC (DS1307): Mention its accuracy, drift over time, and the battery backup feature.

- PIR Sensor: Include sensitivity to motion, coverage area, and working range.
    - voltage
    - power consumption
    - Delay time: Adjustable (.3->5min)
    - 

- LEDs and Resistors: Include forward voltage, resistor values to ensure optimal current, and power ratings for LEDs and resistors.
